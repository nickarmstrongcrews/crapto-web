<h3>N4R FAQ</h3>

<h4>What is NFTs for Refugees (N4R)?</h4>
<h5>Unlike other charitable organizations, we believe in looking beyond the *immediate* needs of refugees to consider their *long-term* welfare. We give them NFTs to set them up to succeed in the growing digital economy of tomorrow, striking a hearty blow against the spectre of generational poverty.</h5>

<h4>What is an NFT?</h4>
<h5>Our NFTs are "non-food tokens," which work exactly the same way as the more common "non-fungible token" NFTs (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">Wikipedia article</a>).</h5>

<h4>How do the NFTs get to the refugees?</h4>
<h5>Any refugee may enter the <a href="/n4r_refugee">refugee portal</a> and access their NFT.</h5>

<h4>Can I donate existing external NFTs?</h4>
<h5>Not currently; we are working on this feature and hope it will be available soon.</h5>

<h4>Can I export my NFT outside of this site?</h4>
<h5>No, your NFT is not for you; it is for refugees. If you are a donor *and* a refugee, you may access your NFT through the <a href="/n4r_refugee">refugee portal</a>.</h5>

<h4>How do I get an NFT to donate?</h4>
<h5>You can generate and purchase a new NFT in exchange for Crapto currency.</h5>

<h4>How do I get Crapto currency?</a>
<h5>You can create an empty Crapto wallet (at <a href="/">craptocurrency.net</a>) and mine some. It should take roughly 1 second to mine enough Crapto to buy an NFT.</h5>

<h4>Is this NFT worth anything?</h4>
<h5>There is no inherent value in our NFTs, just like any other NFT. However, there may be demand, and anything in demand has value. One external NFT <a href="https://decrypt.co/62898/most-expensive-nfts-ever-sold">sold</a> for US$70 million.</h5>

<h4>Are NFTs and cryptocurrency related?</h4>
<h5>They are both based on blockchain technology to verify transactions. Additionally, many NFTs may be bought (or sold) in exchange for cryptocurrency.</h5>

<h4>Is this real?</h4>
<h5>Is anything "real?" Are other NFTs "real?"</h5>

<h4>Is this a joke?</h4>
<h5>Yes. But it is also an NFT.</h5>

<h4>This is not funny. Why are you wasting people's time and resources?</h4>
<h5>
Judge not too harshly, because for every hour of time spent building this site, we have donated a matching amount of our hourly wage and our employer has donated the same amount. NFTs are funny, but not refugees. 
</h5>

<h4>How do I donate to refugee's immediate needs?</h4>
